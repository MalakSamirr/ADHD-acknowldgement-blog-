        Everybody can have difficulty sitting still, paying attention or controlling impulsive behavior
         once in a while. For some people, however, the problems are so pervasive and persistent that they
         interfere with every aspect of their life: home, academic, social and work.<br>

        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 11 percent
         of school-age children. Symptoms continue into adulthood in more than three-quarters of cases.<br>
          ADHD is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity and
           hyperactivity.<br>  

      Individuals with ADHD can be very successful in life. However, without identification and proper
       treatment, ADHD may have serious consequences, including school failure, family stress and disruption,
        depression, problems with relationships, substance abuse, delinquency, accidental injuries and job
         failure. Early identification and treatment are extremely important.<br> 

        Medical science first documented children exhibiting inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity 
        in 1902. Since that time, the disorder has been given numerous names, including minimal brain
         dysfunction, hyperkinetic reaction of childhood, and attention-deficit disorder with or without
          hyperactivity. With the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) classification
           system, the disorder has been renamed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or ADHD.<br>
            The current name reflects the importance of the inattention aspect of the disorder as well as
             the other characteristics of the disorder such as hyperactivity and impulsivity.<br><br>
      <b class="s">Confusing labels for ADHD:</b><br><br>
      In 1994, the name of the disorder was changed in a way that is confusing for many people. Since that
       time all forms of attention deficit disorder are officially called “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
        Disorder,” regardless of whether the individual has symptoms of hyperactivity or not. Even 
         these are the official labels, a lot of professionals and lay people still use both terms: ADD and 
         ADHD. Some use those terms to designate the old subtypes; others use ADD just as a shorter way to
          refer to any presentation.<br><br>
        <b class="s">Types:</b><br><br>

<b style=" font-size:18px">There are three different types of ADHD, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:</b><br><br>

<h4>1.Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:</h4>
 It is hard for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to follow
  instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.<br>
<h4>2.Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:</h4>
 The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long 
 (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may run, jump or climb constantly. The individual
  feels restless and has trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot,
   grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait
    their turn or listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and
     injuries than others.<br>
<h4>3.Combined Presentation:</h4> 
Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the person.
Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over time as well.<br>
<h4 class="s">ADHD in Adults:</h4>
ADHD can last into adulthood. Some adults have ADHD but have never been diagnosed. The symptoms can
 cause difficulty at work, at home, or with relationships. Symptoms may look different at older ages,
  for example, hyperactivity may appear as extreme restlessness. Symptoms can become more severe when the
   demands of adulthood increase.
