            Many parents tend to blame themselves when diagnosing their child with ADHD, but researchers
            are increasingly convinced, over time, that the factors causing the disorder are due to genetic
            traits, not to bad or wrong choices made by parents.
            At the same time, there are certain environmental factors that may influence or exacerbate a
            child's behavior. Although only a few mysteries of attention deficit disorder have been revealed,
            researchers have been able to identify some factors that may have an effect on this disorder:</p>
            <p>
            • Change in brain structure or performance: While the exact cause of ADHD is still
            unknown, brain scans have shown that significant changes have occurred in the
            structure and functioning of the brain in people with this disorder. It has been
            observed, for example, the presence of reduced activity in the brain regions
            responsible for activity and attention.</p>
            <P>
            • Heredity: ADHD appears to be transmitted genetically, from generation to
            generation. Research has shown that one out of every forty children suffering
            from the disorder has at least one family member who suffers from the same
            disorder.</P>
            <p>
            • Maternal smoking during pregnancy, use of addictive substances and exposure to
            toxic substances: A pregnant woman who smokes increases the likelihood of
            having a child with ADHD. Also, excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages
            and the abuse of addictive substances during pregnancy would cause a decrease in
            the activity of neurons (neurons) that produce chemical messengers between
            nerves (Neurotransmitter). Pregnant women who are exposed to toxic
            environmental pollutants are also more likely to have babies with symptoms of
            ADHD.</p>
            <b class="s"> Risk factors that increase the risk of developing ADHD include:</b>
            
           <p> 1. Exposure of the fetus to toxic substance. </p>
           <p> 2. Smoking, drinking alcohol or consuming addictive substances, during pregnancy. </p>
           <P> 3. A family history of ADHD or other behavioral or psychiatric disorders. </P>
           <p> 4. Preterm birth. </p>
           <b class="s"> ADHD is often accompanied by other phenomena, including:</b>
           <p> 1. Hyperthyroidism. </p>
           <p> 2. Learning dyslexia, or genius. </p>
          <p>3. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). </p>
