The term ADHD is a combination of two terms for attention-deficit disorder (ADD), which is associated with
 hyperactivity disorder. The term ADHD expresses the two main components of the disorder: attention deficit
  and hyperactivity disorder that is associated with impulsivity (Impulsivity / Impulsiveness).<br>
Although some children with ADHD suffer from one side of this equation, most children suffer from a mixture
 that includes both disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hyperactivity disorder). 
 In particular, the first signs and symptoms of ADHD appear when activities that require focus
  and mental effort.<br>
Most children diagnosed with ADHD develop signs and symptoms of ADHD before they reach the age of seven.
 Even the first symptoms can appear, in some children, at a younger age, such as during breastfeeding, for 
 example.<br><br>
<b class = "s">Symptoms that indicate attention deficit disorder include:</b><br><br>
•	The child's inability , most of the time, to pay attention to details or make some mistakes
 due to the lack of attention in preparing his homework, or when performing other activities.<br>
•	The child's inability, most of the time, to remain alert and alert while performing certain tasks,
 schoolwork, or while playing. The child appears not to listen to what is being said to him, even when
  directed directly to him.<br>
•	The child shows difficulty in implementing or following instructions, and most 
of the time he does not succeed in completing his homework, homework or other duties.<br>
•	The child exhibits difficulty in organizing while preparing homework or while carrying
 out other tasks.<br>
•	The child avoids fulfilling the duties he does not like and that require intellectual effort,
 such as homework at school or homework.<br>
•	Often children with this disorder tend to waste their belongings, such as books, pens, toys and tools.<br>
•	A child with this disorder can be distracted very easily.<br>
•	Often a child tends to forget some things.<br>
•	The child exhibits uneasiness, nervousness and a lot of writhing.<br>
•	The child tends to leave his sitting position in the classroom, often, or finds it difficul
 to sit in his place for a long period of time in cases that are expected to do so.<br>
•	The child tends to run or climb, and often he performs these behaviors in an exaggerated manner
 and in a way that is not commensurate with the situation.<br>
•	Most of the time a child cannot play with peace and quiet.<br>
•	The child appears always active and mobile most of the time.<br>
•	The child tends to talk excessively.<br>
•	The child tends to answer before he finishes hearing the question (before hearing the whole question).<br>
•	Most of the time the child cannot wait for his turn and stick to the role.<br>
•	The child tends to interrupt speech or get confused when others are talking or playing.<br><br>
<b class = "s">Symptoms that indicate hyperactivity and impulsive behavior disorder include:</b><br><br>
There is a difference in the behaviors of people with ADHD between boys and girls:<br>
•	Boys' behavior is predominantly hyperactivity, while girls are less likely to be attentive.<br>
•	The lack of attention in girls is mainly daydreaming, while the hyperactivity of boys is the te
ndency to play or be preoccupied with things that are silly and not targeted.<br>
•	Boys tend to be less listening and follow the instructions of their teachers or other adults, which 
makes the problematic behavior more noticeable and prominent.<br><br>
If you notice that some of your child's behaviors are frequently hyperactive or inattentive, there may be room 
to suspect that your child's behavior is due to ADHD, if:<br>

•	These behaviors continue for a period of time that exceeds six months.<br>
•	The occurrence of these behaviors in more than one setting (often, both at school and at home).<br>
•	If a child is constantly nagging and nagging at school, whether during play or during other daily a
ctivities.<br>
•	If the child's relationships with adults or with his peers from among the children are problematic.<br><br>
 <b class = "s">Normal behaviors versus behaviors in an ADHD setting:</b><br><br>
Most healthy children suffer from a lack of attention, hyperactivity or impulsive behaviors at some point in
 their lives.
For example, parents may worry about their three-year-old's behavior if he does not listen to a story they
 tell him from beginning to end, and they suspect that not listening to the whole story stems from his ADHD.<br>
But most children of pre-school age tend to be concentrated for short periods of time, and therefore they are 
not able to continue doing one activity for a relatively long period of time. In addition, the area of focus 
for students of school age, or even among adults, often depends on their interest in the topic of the activity.<br>

Teens may be able, for example, to listen to music or talk to their friends for hours, while they find it
 difficult to concentrate for a long time when preparing their homework and homework.
This holds true for hyperactivity, too. Children naturally enjoy high vitality, as they cause their parents
 fatigue and fatigue before they themselves become tired. In some cases, children may become hyperactive 
 after becoming stressed, hungry, anxious , or exposed to a new environment.
In addition, some children, by their nature, are more lively than others. Therefore, no child should be
 classified as having ADHD just because they behave differently from their siblings or their peers.<br>
It is not correct to classify children who show some problems in their behavior in the context of school, only
 while they behave normally at home or when playing with their friends, as having ADHD. This applies to both
  types, i.e. children with hyperactivity disorder, as well as those with attention deficit disorder, as 
  long as their actions do not harm their relationships with their friends or the performance of their
   homework.<br><br>
<b class = "s">symptoms in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may include:</b><br><br>
•	Tendency to behave impulsively.<br>
•	Disorganization and problems in prioritizing.<br>
•	Poor time management skills.<br>
•	Problems focusing on a specific task.<br>
•	Difficulty multitasking.<br>
•	Excessive activity or restlessness.<br>
•	Poor planning.<br>
•	Impaired ability to self-control.<br>
•	Frequent mood swings.<br>
•	Difficulty continuing and completing tasks.<br>
•	Irritable mood.<br>
•	Problems dealing with stressful situations.<br>
